1.  The main elements appear, with the score being zero and pillars being stationary. 
(Team works together at this stage) 
 
2a. One team member splits to work on the blips, making sure they appear as a sprite and 
naturally move down the screen. 
3a. The teammate makes sure that the blips spawn naturally, typically through a timed system. 
4a. The teammate will also make a sort of shield system for the blips, where they need to be hit 
once more to be taken down. 
5a. The teammate can also work on a displayed score, which will be tied to the blip class. 
 
2b. The other teammate splits to work on the pillars, making sure they appear on the screen and 
can move on button inputs. 
3b. The other teammate makes sure that the pillars can extend on button input, both extending 
and retracting, and that this ability can only be done when the pillar isn’t extended. 
4b. The other teammate will also make sure that the pillars can’t ‘pass’ each other, that is to say, 
one cant extend past the other if it’s in the way. 
 
5. The teammates reconvene, working on making the blips and pillars interact with one another, 
the pillars removing the blips when they extend and touch them, and increasing the score when 
this happens. 
6. The shielded blips will be worked on now that both pillars and blips are implemented, 
working such that when a pillar hits the shielded blip, it becomes a normal blip, this not adding 
to the score, but the next hit that destroys the blip adding to the score. 
7.  (unofficial) An obstacle class that could move either left or down will appear on either the 
right or top side of the screen, respectively, that would stop the pillars extension if it were to hit 
it.
