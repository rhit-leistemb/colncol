# Column Collision 
 
The objective of the game is to hit a moving blip using two columns confined to the horizontal and vertical axis. The two columns can be moved up and down or left and right, respective to whichever axis the column is on, using two sets of controls. If the player triggers the two columns at the same time in attempt to hit the blip with both, the columns can hit each other and stop each other from moving. As the game progresses, the blip will change and adopt different attributes, making levels unique. A score tally would be included as well, increasing every time a blip is hit and destroyed.  
 
## Essentials 
- Moving avatar to hit = blip 
- Columns that can be controlled by the player, moved and triggered, on both axes 
- Columns blocking each other 
- A score tally  

## Anticipated 
- Sound effects: different hit sounds for blips, pillars hitting, pillar triggered 
- Background music 
- Different types of blips: speed, shield (number of hits), sizes, multiple blips 
- Time delay if you miss blip

## Explain briefly what your project does and how it works.
        The goal of the project was to create a game where the player controls the movement of two pillars,
        lining them up so that when the pillars "launch," they hit and destroy a blip (the moving circular object.
        Everytime a blip is destroyed the player moves on to the next level where they will encounter a different type
        of blip until the player completes all the levels.
